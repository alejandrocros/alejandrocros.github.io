I am Alejandro (or Alex), Research Engineer at Google Paris working on Responsible AI development (with focus on NLP models).

Previously, I worked at [Criteo AI Lab](https://ailab.criteo.com/) as Research Science Intern (Transfer Learning with Multilingual Transformers) and at [Seedtag](https://www.seedtag.com/) (cookieless advertising).


## Research Interests

My main research interests are Natural Language Processing (both NLU and NLG) and Reinforcement Learning (especially Deep Learning combined with Monte-Carlo methods).

I am aware of the potential risks behind Artificial Intelligence, so I am firmly convinced that mitigating and anticipating them is one of the most important challenges in the field. Hence, I am very interested in the ethical aspects of AI development, such as AI-alignment, fairness and privacy-preserving models.
## Other Interests
I'm also fascinated about physics and mathematics, especially Quantum Computing, General Relativity and Topology. In my spare time I enjoy doing half-distance races (10K, half-marathon), climbing, scuba-diving (Advanced Diver), playing chess and traveling. Moreover, I've always been passionate about literature and languages. As of today, I speak four (and a half) of them and I always try to learn more.
