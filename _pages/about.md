I am Alejandro, a Machine Learning Research Engineer with experience both in Research and Development. I have worked for multiple years in Natural Language Processing. Lately, I've worked at Criteo AI Lab as Research Science Intern in transfer learning with multilingual NLP models (specially Transformer-based) and explanaibility.

## Current situation
As of today, I'm looking for a position as Engineer in a research lab (either in a company or a public lab).

## Research Interests

My main research interests are Natural Language Processing (both NLU and NLG) and Reinforcement Learning (specially Deep Learning combined with Monte-Carlo methods). I am very interested in the ethical aspects of AI development, such as AI-alignment, fairness and privacy-preserving models.

## Other Interests
I'm also very interested in theoretical physics (QFT and Relativity) and topology. In my spare time I enjoy doing half-distance races (10K, half-marathon), climbing, scuba-diving (Advanced Diver) and travelling. Moreover, I've always been a passionate about languages and literature. As of today, I fluently speak four of them and I always try to learn more.
