I have been part of multiple projects related to Software and Artificial Intelligence. In this page you can find some of them. In case you want to know more about any of them, feel free to ping me via mail.

### mctchess (Monte-Carlo Tree Search applied to chess) Python Library

This [repository](https://github.com/alejandrocros/monte_carlo_tree_chess) contains personal implementations of different Monte Carlo Tree Search methods to the game of chess, with efficient code implementation, comparison of the results and examples of use. *[PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT]*.
### Qrangen (Random Number Generator using Quantum computing).
Project developed as part of IBM's Qiskit Hackathon in Madrid, 2019. We created an easy-to-use application for generation of pure random numbers using measurements over Quantum circuits. [Here](https://github.com/alejandrocros/Qrangen) you can find the code.

### Open Source Contributions
- Added Wiki Bio dataset to HuggingFace [datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) library.
- Added support of Galician language to [langdetect](https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect) Python package.

### Kaggle Competitions
Some time ago I used to participate in Kaggle competitions in my free time. Here you can find some information about them:
#### [OpenVaccine: COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine)

Prediction of the degradation rates at various locations along RNA sequence to improve stability of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. My team finished in top 3% out of more than 1600 teams with a solution mixing classical Deep Learning techniques (feed-forward, GRU's) with Graph Machine Learning techniques.

#### [Cornell Birdcall Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/birdsong-recognition)
Identification of birds species in audio recordings.  My team finished in top 6% out of more than 1300 teams.
#### [Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news/)
Prediction of future stock price returns based on market data and news information. My team finished in top 3% out of more than 2900 teams with a solution combining NLP techniques with time-series forecasting.
